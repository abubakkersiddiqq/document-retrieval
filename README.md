Document Retrieval System (CSV Semantic Search)

A complete, end-to-end document retrieval pipeline built using:

Pandas for CSV loading

Sentence Transformers for generating embeddings

ChromaDB as a vector database

TheFuzz for column selection via fuzzy matching

This project loads a CSV file, converts its rows into embeddings, stores them in ChromaDB, and retrieves semantically similar entries based on natural language queries.
